logical operators :
	1.	LOGICAL OPERATOR QUIZ
The output of the logical operators will be 0 or 1 …for JAVA, they always out either true or false
How is 0 interpreted in Java ? == false
1 == true;

System.out.println(3 > 7 && 1 > 0) —> false(Not 0)

(1) —> true
NON JAVA EXAMPLES
	1.	 (!0 ) —> (1) —> true
	2.	 ( 3 % 2 ) —> ‘%’== remainder —> 1 —> true 

JAVA EXAMPLES…applicable in JAVA as well
	1.	 (5 + 4 < 3 && 7 + 3 <= 20 ) —> false.  false && anything —> false

	1.	 ( 'a' != 'b' - 1) —> 97 != 98-1 === 97 != 97 === false
	2.	char as a datatype in java. In java, a character is something is enclosed in single inverted commas
	3.	char variable = ‘a’; // every character value has a corresponding ASCII value(helps to show textual data : American Standard Code For Information Interchange). And this value is an integer. a == 97, b=98, c=99..
	4.	A=65, B=66, C=67…..  
	5.	 ( ! (7 == 7 )) ===== (! true) === false; 
	6.	 ( !1 || !0 ) ===== false ? (False || True) ==== True
	7.	|| Short Circuit Property : true || anything : true;
	x++ : inline operators(pre and post increment/decrement operators) 
	8.	 ( 'a' == 97 ) ==== (97 == 97)===true;  

ANSWERS

	1.	1. not FALSE is TRUE
	2.	0 ...because 9 < 3 && 10 <= 20 is ....FALSE && TRUE is.... FALSE
	3.	0 ...because 'a' != 'b' - 1 is the same as 'a' != 'a'. This is clearly FALSE.
	4.	0 ...because !(7==7) is the same as !TRUE which is FALSE.
	5.	1 ...because 3 % 2 is equal to 1.
	6.	1... because !1 || !0 is the same as !TRUE || ! FALSE which is TRUE.
	7.	1 ....because 'a' can be represented by the ascii character code 97. 'a' == 97 is TRUE!
