PUT Operation in HM:

Public Integer put(String key, value) {
Int hash = hash(key); // Compute the hashCode of Key using key.hashCode()
Node node = new Node(hash, key, value);
Int bucketIndex = hash % internalHM.length;//this will make sure that the bucketIndex lies between 0 and internalHM.length -1
if(internalHM[bucketIndex] == null ) {//there is no value in that index...i.e. the bucket is empty
	internalHM[bucketIndex] = node;
} else {
	node.next = internalHM[bucketIndex];
	internalHM[bucketIndex] = node;//basically, node now becomes the head of the linkedlist present at index internalHM[bucketIndex]
}
}


HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new .,..... // An array called ‘internalHM’ is created of a fixed size(16)
public int hashCode() {
   int h = hash;//1
   if (h == 0 && value.length > 0) {
       char val[] = value;

       for (int i = 0; i < value.length; i++) {
           h = 31 * h + val[i];//ASCII value of the character
       }
       hash = h;
   }
   return h;
}



GET Operation :
10100110100011110011011 → hash value in binary
00000000000000000001111
A & 1 = A

thresholdCapacity(0.75) -- > If my internalHM array gets 75% filled, then we increase the size of my internalHM by 100%. I will have to perform Rehashing(Why ? )

Out of 10000 insertions, I will have to do this rehashing 13-14 times...99987 times the complexity is O(1), it is only the 13 operations that take O()  → Amortized Complexity

HashMap<Integer, RandomClass(address to an object on the heap)> hm;

RandomClass rc = hm.get(0);


==================
Discussion during lecture :

--WHen we say that a HashSet runs contains operation in O(1) time, how exactly does it accomplishes that task.
--The exact theory and algorithm behind how it does it

--What is the purpose of hashCode in Hashing datastructures in java ?
  hm.put(key, value);
  --The hashCode of key determines the bucket in which my value should be put inside the HashMap
--What is the purpose of Next Pointer in Node class ?
    --It is used to handle collisions
    --Two objects that are not equal can also return the same hashCode


=======
GET :
Integer value = hm.get(key);

get(key) {
compute the hash of key to get the unique hashcode...hash

bucketIndex = hash % hm.length;


}
--the Right Hand Thumb Rule...
Suppose two objects are equal.....
emp1 = new Employee(1)


hm.put(emp1, average value that I have computed)

.....
....
....
Employee emp2 = new Employee(1)
hm.get(emp2);
emp2.hashCode should return the same value that was returned for emp1.


========
IF WE USE VERY BAD HASHCODE IMPLEMENTING TECHNIQUE
emp1 = new Employee(1);
hm.put(emp1, some value);

emp2 = new Employee(2);
hm.get(emp2);
