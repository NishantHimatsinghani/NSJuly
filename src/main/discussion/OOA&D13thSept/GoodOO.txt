Avoid Duplication :

  DogDoor Application
          DogDoor :
            open(){
              open the door
              keep the door open for predefined amount of time
              close the door
            }
            close(){}
          Remote to open the door
          Remote :
            --if(button is pressed and door is open) {
                close the door
              }
              else if (button is pressed and door is closed) {
                DogDoor.open()

              }

          BarkRecognizer opens the door as well

          BarkRecognizer :
              -- if(detect the voice of the Dog) {
                  DogDoor.open()
                }
              }
