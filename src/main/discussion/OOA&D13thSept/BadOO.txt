        DogDoor Application
        DogDoor :
          open(){}
          close(){}
        Remote to open the door
        Remote :
          --if(button is pressed and door is open) {
              close the door
            }
            else if (button is pressed and door is closed) {
              open the door
              wait till I make the voice controlled CLOSE command
              close the door

            }

        BarkRecognizer opens the door as well

        BarkRecognizer :
            -- if(detect the voice of the Dog) {
                open the door
                wait till I make the voice controlled CLOSE command
                close the door
              }
            }
