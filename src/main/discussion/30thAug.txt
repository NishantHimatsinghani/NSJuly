Time Complexity :
  TC is a metric used to determine the efficiency of algorithms....to compare the efficiency

  Why do we in particular have chose size of input as the varying factor to calculate the TC?
    --O(N), O(f(N))....N == size of the input over which my algorithm is running..
    --The size of input is the only factor of the algorithm that is HARDWARE AGNOSTIC

    --We are calculating the number of iterations/operations that are performed by the algorithm as a
        function of N(size of input)

    --Whenever we are calculating the time complexity, we often think about WORST-CASE.
        Because the input is not in the programmers control. It is unpredictable.
        So we consider the worst-case so that we can accordingly generalise the algorithmic analysis between various algorithms.
    --When we say WORST_CASE, we also increase the size of the input.
    i.e. to say we assume our N to be very large number

    --Constants add unnecessary complexity to the overall formula without adding much value.
      --So we ignore constants from the overall formula

    --We ignore the less significant terms from the time complexity formula.
