    1. Create a class called Propagate and a main() method, which will remain
    empty for now.
    2. Create a method called reverse. It takes an argument of a String and
    returns a String.
    3. In reverse, check whether the String has a length of 0 by using the
    String.length() method. If the length is 0, the reverse method will
    throw an exception.
    4. Now include the code to reverse the order of the String. Because this isn't
    the main topic of this chapter, the reversal code has been provided, but feel
    free to try it on your own.
    String reverseStr = "";
    for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;--i) {
    reverseStr += s.charAt(i);
    }
    return reverseStr;
    5. Now in the main() method you will attempt to call this method and deal
    with any potential exceptions. Additionally, you will include a finally
    statement that displays when main() has finished.
